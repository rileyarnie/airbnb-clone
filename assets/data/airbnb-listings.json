    "neighborhood_overview": "LOCATION: Easter Road is great neighbourhood that i've seen go from strength to strength over the last decade. Close to the city centre but with its own identity and community. In the immediate vicinity we have the best Italian restaurant, best bakery, best off-license, my favourite pub and the best Thai food i've eaten since Bangkok. There are cool cafes, vintage shops and an award-winning local supermarket (as well a choice of big supermarkets slightly further away, perhaps 10 minutes walk). The flat is central enough that many guests walk everywhere. You will find high street shopping, restaurants, pubs, historic tourist attractions and the picturesque walks that Edinburgh is famed for. PLACES OF INTEREST: The Royal Mile is less than 1 mile away, it is the heart of Edinburgh's old town. It links Holyrood Palace (the Queen's official residence in Scotland) and the Scottish Parliament with Edinburgh Castle. Halfway up is a section called High Street which is the epicentre of street th",
    "notes": "DISCOUNTS Some discounts are applied automatically. For example, if you stay for a week you get one night free and if you stay for a month you only pay for 3 weeks. AirBnB's system is good but not perfect so I have to apply some discounts manually. In particular if more than 1 person stays in this room for a week or more then I will manually apply a discount to the price you are quoted. When you enquire about renting this room I will send you a special offer with the correct price.",
    "transit": "PUBLIC TRANSPORT: Edinburgh is a small city so many guests find they can walk everywhere they wish to visit. However, if you prefer public transport or wish to visit the attractions on Edinburgh's outskirts (such as Rosslyn, Cramond and Portobello) then a close by bus route will take you there. The buses are now GPS tracked with arrival boards at the stops and you can even download a free app to your phone to see exactly how soon the next one is arriving.",
    "access": "CAPACITY: This listing is for a private room with a double bed which will sleep 2 people comfortably.",
    "interaction": "ARRIVING: The flat is about a mile from Waverley Train Station; you can walk, catch the no.1 bus or jump in a taxi. From the airport you can catch the regular (and inexpensive) no. 35 bus which brings you all the way to the flat in about an hour. SETTLING INTO THE FLAT: I will meet you when you arrive to hand over a set of keys, show you round the flat and answer any questions you may have about the accommodation, location and Edinburgh in general. After that, well I live here so ask questions when you see me or call if i'm out. You will get my email address when your booking is confirmed and my phone number is on all the key fobs.",
    "house_rules": "No smoking in the building. Please check if anyone needs to use the bathroom before taking a shower. Please keep communal areas tidy, especially the kitchen: Wipe surfaces, put dirty dishes in the dish-washer and wash pots, etc. Please use and enjoy the home cinema carefully and put CDs away. Full instructions can be found in the house manual. If you have issues please talk to me. Be nice and enjoy your stay. That's about it.",

    "host_about": "Hi!\r\n\r\nAbout me:\r\n\r\nMy name is Adam!  I grew up in Scotland so having a laugh is definitely the most important thing to me! I also love meeting new people and sharing past experiences with them which is why I am opening my home to people on airbnb. Some of my closest friendships and also business partnerships  have come from very random circumstances - if you are funny and laid back then we will definitely get on!\r\n\r\nI started my career as a surgical doctor before founding a health & fitness tech company. I now live between London and San Francisco. I love to travel and I have been lucky enough to visit some amazing places all over the world. I have to say that  I am very fussy about where I stay, which is why you can be sure that my home is of a high standard! I have set up my home in such a way that people can feel they are in a boutique hotel but also have some important home comforts too. As I travel so much it is the perfect way I would like to visit new places whether I was on a business trip or on holiday! \r\n\r\nAbout me as a host:\r\n\r\nMy hosting style is very relaxed and (I like to think) warm and friendly. The Scottish in me really kicks in I think! I look forward to meeting all you fun, interesting people out there and I hope you enjoy the way in which I have adapted my beautiful London Townhouse for you!\r\n\r\nDespite being on airbnb for 2 months, I have hosted over 80 times and I have been really grateful to have met so many interesting people. I want to thank my guests for leaving such kind, warm words about me and my home.  Here are a sample of my guest reviews:\r\n\r\n\"Fabulous 4 (URL HIDDEN) our 50's. Thought it would be hard to give up our 5 star travelling days.But this gorgeous Chiswick English house generated warmth,oozed comfort, and delivered all it said it (URL HIDDEN) added extra was the charm and character of the (URL HIDDEN) nice to feel at ease and welcome.A real bonus to meet other people . Would return in a flash\" Georges and Debbie\r\n\r\n\"Adam's room is even better than what the pictures show, very bright and large and in a very nice neighborhood. The location is great, in a very residential neighborhood, but with many nice restaurants around, and walking distance to the tube station. Also, Adam made me feel very welcome, gave me all the instructions and help needed. Overall, it was a very good experience! Thank you, Adam!\" Betina\r\n\r\n\"Simply the best BNB experience I have had. Large clean rooms in a well organised apartment. Key code worked a dream and so much easier than meeting someone with the key when your phone does not work in that country. Also cheapest apartment in the area so what a deal to find it was a great place all round. Adam was just so friendly and professional. If I lived in that street he would be my new best friend! was a little concerned by a previous post, but I got the story from another guest (who had been there for a month! - thats how good a deal this flat it) and they told me what a nightmare this family had been and how Adam had tried to quieten them down to help the other guests and asked them to clean up their kitchen mess and then they wrote that vicous review!) ANyway, stay here. Easy walk to the Tube, amazing nightlife and real London pubs 1 minute a way, and a perfect BNB Host.\"",

    "host_about": "Hi!\r\n\r\nAbout me:\r\n\r\nMy name is Adam!  I grew up in Scotland so having a laugh is definitely the most important thing to me! I also love meeting new people and sharing past experiences with them which is why I am opening my home to people on airbnb. Some of my closest friendships and also business partnerships  have come from very random circumstances - if you are funny and laid back then we will definitely get on!\r\n\r\nI started my career as a surgical doctor before founding a health & fitness tech company. I now live between London and San Francisco. I love to travel and I have been lucky enough to visit some amazing places all over the world. I have to say that  I am very fussy about where I stay, which is why you can be sure that my home is of a high standard! I have set up my home in such a way that people can feel they are in a boutique hotel but also have some important home comforts too. As I travel so much it is the perfect way I would like to visit new places whether I was on a business trip or on holiday! \r\n\r\nAbout me as a host:\r\n\r\nMy hosting style is very relaxed and (I like to think) warm and friendly. The Scottish in me really kicks in I think! I look forward to meeting all you fun, interesting people out there and I hope you enjoy the way in which I have adapted my beautiful London Townhouse for you!\r\n\r\nDespite being on airbnb for 2 months, I have hosted over 80 times and I have been really grateful to have met so many interesting people. I want to thank my guests for leaving such kind, warm words about me and my home.  Here are a sample of my guest reviews:\r\n\r\n\"Fabulous 4 (URL HIDDEN) our 50's. Thought it would be hard to give up our 5 star travelling days.But this gorgeous Chiswick English house generated warmth,oozed comfort, and delivered all it said it (URL HIDDEN) added extra was the charm and character of the (URL HIDDEN) nice to feel at ease and welcome.A real bonus to meet other people . Would return in a flash\" Georges and Debbie\r\n\r\n\"Adam's room is even better than what the pictures show, very bright and large and in a very nice neighborhood. The location is great, in a very residential neighborhood, but with many nice restaurants around, and walking distance to the tube station. Also, Adam made me feel very welcome, gave me all the instructions and help needed. Overall, it was a very good experience! Thank you, Adam!\" Betina\r\n\r\n\"Simply the best BNB experience I have had. Large clean rooms in a well organised apartment. Key code worked a dream and so much easier than meeting someone with the key when your phone does not work in that country. Also cheapest apartment in the area so what a deal to find it was a great place all round. Adam was just so friendly and professional. If I lived in that street he would be my new best friend! was a little concerned by a previous post, but I got the story from another guest (who had been there for a month! - thats how good a deal this flat it) and they told me what a nightmare this family had been and how Adam had tried to quieten them down to help the other guests and asked them to clean up their kitchen mess and then they wrote that vicous review!) ANyway, stay here. Easy walk to the Tube, amazing nightlife and real London pubs 1 minute a way, and a perfect BNB Host.\"",

I love the sea air, the local community, which combined give Joppa a very local feel but none-the-less minutes from the city centre. \r\nFor those travelling by road we are just of the main city by pass and the A1 to the east of the city.  Joppa and Portobello are well sign posted so you shouldn\u2019t have any trouble, however if you do feel free to call.  \r\n\r\nI particular enjoy the Air B&B experience given the diversity of people it allows me to meet.  I am passionate about my hometown and all too happy to offer up advice, guidance and support for anyone wishing to travel here irrespective if you are staying with me.\r\n\r\nOutside the peak season, I am also happy to cater for those on short to long-term work commitments.  Please call to discuss opportunities we may have.",

We love spending lots of time outdoors - biking, climbing, walking - and when we are home we like relaxing, crafting, tinkering on the computer, cooking and baking.  Food is a big part of our lives!\r\n\r\nWe love travelling and experiencing new things and meeting new people - we welcome you as a guest into our home and look forward to sharing some stories and getting to know you a little bit (*we look forward to chatting with you if you are feeling sociable; if not we are more than happy to give you your own space - we know the feeling of just wanting to get to bed!).\r\n\r\nAs your hosts, we try to be as flexible and accommodating as possible - so if you choose to stay with us, please let us know if you have any special requirements.  \r\n\r\nLife in our little house is comfortable we believe a home should be a 'cozy machine for living in' - that means that we like to make sure the space is both functional and works well both for us as a family and for you as our guest, and yet also that the space is homely and a pleasant place to spend time in.  If you stay with us, we hope you will find our place warm and welcoming.\r\n\r\nWe have also had many adventures in our lovely yellow VW T4 camper van, and our van is available to rent out on a daily basis.",

    "host_about": "Hi!\r\n\r\nAbout me:\r\n\r\nMy name is Adam!  I grew up in Scotland so having a laugh is definitely the most important thing to me! I also love meeting new people and sharing past experiences with them which is why I am opening my home to people on airbnb. Some of my closest friendships and also business partnerships  have come from very random circumstances - if you are funny and laid back then we will definitely get on!\r\n\r\nI started my career as a surgical doctor before founding a health & fitness tech company. I now live between London and San Francisco. I love to travel and I have been lucky enough to visit some amazing places all over the world. I have to say that  I am very fussy about where I stay, which is why you can be sure that my home is of a high standard! I have set up my home in such a way that people can feel they are in a boutique hotel but also have some important home comforts too. As I travel so much it is the perfect way I would like to visit new places whether I was on a business trip or on holiday! \r\n\r\nAbout me as a host:\r\n\r\nMy hosting style is very relaxed and (I like to think) warm and friendly. The Scottish in me really kicks in I think! I look forward to meeting all you fun, interesting people out there and I hope you enjoy the way in which I have adapted my beautiful London Townhouse for you!\r\n\r\nDespite being on airbnb for 2 months, I have hosted over 80 times and I have been really grateful to have met so many interesting people. I want to thank my guests for leaving such kind, warm words about me and my home.  Here are a sample of my guest reviews:\r\n\r\n\"Fabulous 4 (URL HIDDEN) our 50's. Thought it would be hard to give up our 5 star travelling days.But this gorgeous Chiswick English house generated warmth,oozed comfort, and delivered all it said it (URL HIDDEN) added extra was the charm and character of the (URL HIDDEN) nice to feel at ease and welcome.A real bonus to meet other people . Would return in a flash\" Georges and Debbie\r\n\r\n\"Adam's room is even better than what the pictures show, very bright and large and in a very nice neighborhood. The location is great, in a very residential neighborhood, but with many nice restaurants around, and walking distance to the tube station. Also, Adam made me feel very welcome, gave me all the instructions and help needed. Overall, it was a very good experience! Thank you, Adam!\" Betina\r\n\r\n\"Simply the best BNB experience I have had. Large clean rooms in a well organised apartment. Key code worked a dream and so much easier than meeting someone with the key when your phone does not work in that country. Also cheapest apartment in the area so what a deal to find it was a great place all round. Adam was just so friendly and professional. If I lived in that street he would be my new best friend! was a little concerned by a previous post, but I got the story from another guest (who had been there for a month! - thats how good a deal this flat it) and they told me what a nightmare this family had been and how Adam had tried to quieten them down to help the other guests and asked them to clean up their kitchen mess and then they wrote that vicous review!) ANyway, stay here. Easy walk to the Tube, amazing nightlife and real London pubs 1 minute a way, and a perfect BNB Host.\"",

I want to thank my guests for leaving such kind, warm words about me and my home.  Here are a sample of my guest reviews:\r\n\r\n\"Fabulous 4 (URL HIDDEN) our 50's. Thought it would be hard to give up our 5 star travelling days.But this gorgeous Chiswick English house generated warmth,oozed comfort, and delivered all it said it (URL HIDDEN) added extra was the charm and character of the (URL HIDDEN) nice to feel at ease and welcome.A real bonus to meet other people . Would return in a flash\" Georges and Debbie\r\n\r\n\"Adam's room is even better than what the pictures show, very bright and large and in a very nice neighborhood. The location is great, in a very residential neighborhood, but with many nice restaurants around, and walking distance to the tube station. Also, Adam made me feel very welcome, gave me all the instructions and help needed. Overall, it was a very good experience! Thank you, Adam!\" Betina\r\n\r\n\"Simply the best BNB experience I have had. Large clean rooms in a well organised apartment. Key code worked a dream and so much easier than meeting someone with the key when your phone does not work in that country. Also cheapest apartment in the area so what a deal to find it was a great place all round. Adam was just so friendly and professional. If I lived in that street he would be my new best friend! was a little concerned by a previous post, but I got the story from another guest (who had been there for a month! - thats how good a deal this flat it) and they told me what a nightmare this family had been and how Adam had tried to quieten them down to help the other guests and asked them to clean up their kitchen mess and then they wrote that vicous review!) ANyway, stay here. Easy walk to the Tube, amazing nightlife and real London pubs 1 minute a way, and a perfect BNB Host.\"",

I love playing chess and reading books which will also be left to your disposition. \r\nMy house is very homely, it is quite far from aesthetics of hotel standards. It is however filled with joy and fun and surrounded by great places to explore whcih I will be more than happy to shere with you!",

    "neighborhood_overview": "LOCATION: Abbeyhill / Easter Road is great neighbourhood that i've seen go from strength to strength over the last decade. Close to the city centre but with its own identity and community. In the immediate vicinity we have the best Italian restaurant, best bakery, best off-license, my favourite pub and the best Thai food i've eaten since Bangkok. There are cool cafes, vintage shops and even a big Sainsburys hidden just round the corner. The flat is so central that many guests walk everywhere. The short stroll into town along Regent Road is one of the best views in Edinburgh. On route you will pass Calton Hill which offers the best view of central Edinburgh. You will find high street shopping, restaurants, pubs, historic tourist attractions and the picturesque walks that Edinburgh is famed for. PLACES OF INTEREST: Bristo Square in the Old Town is the hub of the commercial Fringe (Gilded Balloon, Pleasance, Underbelly, etc.). It is about a mile away, walk or catch the 67 bus from just ou",
    "notes": "DISCOUNTS & CHARGES Some discounts are applied automatically. For example, if you stay for a week you get one night free and if you stay for a month you only pay for 3 weeks. AirBnB's system is good but not perfect so I have to apply some discounts manually. In particular if more than 4 people people stay in this flat for a week or more then I will manually apply a discount to the price you are quoted. When you enquire about renting this flat I will send you a special offer with the correct price. Similarly, if you want an extra bed and bedding to be provided beyond the 2 included beds there is a one-off charge that I will apply manually. Regardless the length of your stay bedding for the sofa-bed and the spare mattress cost \u00a310 each.",
    "transit": "PUBLIC TRANSPORT: Edinburgh is a small city so many guests find they can walk everywhere they wish to visit. However, if you prefer public transport or wish to visit the attractions on Edinburgh's outskirts (such as Rosslyn, Cramond and Portobello) then a close by bus route will take you there. The buses are now GPS tracked with arrival boards at the stops and you can even download a free app to your phone to see exactly how soon the next one is arriving.",
    "access": "CAPACITY: This listing is for the whole flat which has 2 bedrooms with dedicated beds for 4 people. The living / dining room is furnished with a sofabed and bedding can be provided for a small additional fee. This allows up to 6 people to stay in the flat comfortably.  There is also a spare mattress which makes sleeping 8 people possible but rather crowded.",
    "interaction": "ARRIVING: The flat is 1.5 miles from Waverley Train Station; you can walk, catch the no.67 bus from The Mound or jump in a taxi. From the airport you can catch the 100 bus to Princes Street and then change to the no.67 bus on The Mound or catch a taxi. SETTLING INTO THE FLAT: I will meet you when you arrive to hand over 2 or 3 sets of keys, show you round the flat and answer any questions you may have about the accommodation, location and Edinburgh in general. After that you're welcome to call or email if you have any queries or issues but I will leave you to enjoy the flat in private. You will get my email address when your booking is confirmed and my phone number is on all the key fobs. I am available 24/7 for emergencies and 11am - 11pm for general questions.",
    "house_rules": "NO smoking inside the flat or stairwell.  If you have to smoke please go outside. Please check if anyone needs to use the bathroom before taking a bath or shower. Please keep the flat reasonably tidy and do your washing up before leaving. Please be courteous and don't disturb the neighbours or other guests. Report any issues promptly so we can sort them out. Pets are only allowed if cleared with myself in advance, a security deposit is paid and they do not damage anything. If you have problems or questions call me on (phone number hidden) - I live across town on Easter Road so can be at the flat in 20 minutes if needed. Be nice and enjoy your stay.",

    "host_about": "Hi!\r\n\r\nAbout me:\r\n\r\nMy name is Adam!  I grew up in Scotland so having a laugh is definitely the most important thing to me! I also love meeting new people and sharing past experiences with them which is why I am opening my home to people on airbnb. Some of my closest friendships and also business partnerships  have come from very random circumstances - if you are funny and laid back then we will definitely get on!\r\n\r\nI started my career as a surgical doctor before founding a health & fitness tech company. I now live between London and San Francisco. I love to travel and I have been lucky enough to visit some amazing places all over the world. I have to say that  I am very fussy about where I stay, which is why you can be sure that my home is of a high standard! I have set up my home in such a way that people can feel they are in a boutique hotel but also have some important home comforts too. As I travel so much it is the perfect way I would like to visit new places whether I was on a business trip or on holiday! \r\n\r\nAbout me as a host:\r\n\r\nMy hosting style is very relaxed and (I like to think) warm and friendly. The Scottish in me really kicks in I think! I look forward to meeting all you fun, interesting people out there and I hope you enjoy the way in which I have adapted my beautiful London Townhouse for you!\r\n\r\nDespite being on airbnb for 2 months, I have hosted over 80 times and I have been really grateful to have met so many interesting people. I want to thank my guests for leaving such kind, warm words about me and my home.  Here are a sample of my guest reviews:\r\n\r\n\"Fabulous 4 (URL HIDDEN) our 50's. Thought it would be hard to give up our 5 star travelling days.But this gorgeous Chiswick English house generated warmth,oozed comfort, and delivered all it said it (URL HIDDEN) added extra was the charm and character of the (URL HIDDEN) nice to feel at ease and welcome.A real bonus to meet other people . Would return in a flash\" Georges and Debbie\r\n\r\n\"Adam's room is even better than what the pictures show, very bright and large and in a very nice neighborhood. The location is great, in a very residential neighborhood, but with many nice restaurants around, and walking distance to the tube station. Also, Adam made me feel very welcome, gave me all the instructions and help needed. Overall, it was a very good experience! Thank you, Adam!\" Betina\r\n\r\n\"Simply the best BNB experience I have had. Large clean rooms in a well organised apartment. Key code worked a dream and so much easier than meeting someone with the key when your phone does not work in that country. Also cheapest apartment in the area so what a deal to find it was a great place all round. Adam was just so friendly and professional. If I lived in that street he would be my new best friend! was a little concerned by a previous post, but I got the story from another guest (who had been there for a month! - thats how good a deal this flat it) and they told me what a nightmare this family had been and how Adam had tried to quieten them down to help the other guests and asked them to clean up their kitchen mess and then they wrote that vicous review!) ANyway, stay here. Easy walk to the Tube, amazing nightlife and real London pubs 1 minute a way, and a perfect BNB Host.\"",

    "neighborhood_overview": "LOCATION: Easter Road is great neighbourhood that i've seen go from strength to strength over the last decade.  Close to the city centre but with its own identity and community.  In the immediate vicinity we have the best Italian restaurant, best bakery, best off-license, my favourite pub and the best Thai food i've eaten since Bangkok.  There are cool cafes, vintage shops and an award-winning local supermarket (as well a choice of big supermarkets slightly further away, perhaps 10 minutes walk). The flat is central enough that many guests walk everywhere.  You will find high street shopping, restaurants, pubs, historic tourist attractions and the picturesque walks that Edinburgh is famed for. PLACES OF INTEREST: The Royal Mile is less than 1 mile away, it is the heart of Edinburgh's old town.  It links Holyrood Palace (the Queen's official residence in Scotland) and the Scottish Parliament with Edinburgh Castle.  Halfway up is a section called High Street which is the epicentre of str",
    "notes": "DISCOUNTS & CHARGES Some discounts are applied automatically.  For example, if you stay for a week you get one night free and if you stay for a month you only pay for 3 weeks.  AirBnB's system is good but not perfect so I have to apply some discounts manually.  In particular if more than 4 people people stay in this flat for a week or more then I will manually apply a discount to the price you are quoted.   When you enquire about renting this flat I will send you a special offer with the correct price.  Similarly, if you want an extra bed and bedding to be provided beyond the 2 included beds there is a one-off charge that I will apply manually.  Regardless the length of your stay an extra single bed and bedding costs \u00a315 while a double bed and bedding costs \u00a325.",

However, if you prefer public transport or wish to visit the attractions on Edinburgh's outskirts (such as Rosslyn, Cramond and Portobello) then a close by bus route will take you there.  The buses are now GPS tracked with arrival boards at the stops and you can even download a free app to your phone to see exactly how soon the next one is arriving.",
    "access": "CAPACITY: This listing is for the whole flat which has 2 bedrooms with dedicated beds for 4 people. The living / dining room is spacious enough to fit another bed which can be provided for a small additional fee. This allows up to 6 people to stay in the flat comfortably.",
    "interaction": "ARRIVING: The flat is about a mile from Waverley Train Station; you can walk, catch the no.1 bus or jump in a taxi.   From the airport you can catch the regular (and inexpensive) no. 35 bus which brings you all the way to the flat in about an hour. SETTLING INTO THE FLAT: I will meet you when you arrive to hand over 2 or 3 sets of keys, show you round the flat and answer any questions you may have about the accommodation, location and Edinburgh in general.  After that you're welcome to call or email if you have any queries or issues but I will leave you to enjoy the flat in private.  You will get my email address when your booking is confirmed, my phone number is on all the key fobs and I live just across the road. I am available 24/7 for emergencies and 11am - 11pm for general questions.",

Pets are only allowed if cleared with myself in advance, a security deposit is paid and they do not damage anything.

    "host_about": "Hi!\r\n\r\nAbout me:\r\n\r\nMy name is Adam!  I grew up in Scotland so having a laugh is definitely the most important thing to me! I also love meeting new people and sharing past experiences with them which is why I am opening my home to people on airbnb. Some of my closest friendships and also business partnerships  have come from very random circumstances - if you are funny and laid back then we will definitely get on!\r\n\r\nI started my career as a surgical doctor before founding a health & fitness tech company. I now live between London and San Francisco. I love to travel and I have been lucky enough to visit some amazing places all over the world. I have to say that  I am very fussy about where I stay, which is why you can be sure that my home is of a high standard! I have set up my home in such a way that people can feel they are in a boutique hotel but also have some important home comforts too. As I travel so much it is the perfect way I would like to visit new places whether I was on a business trip or on holiday! \r\n\r\nAbout me as a host:\r\n\r\nMy hosting style is very relaxed and (I like to think) warm and friendly. The Scottish in me really kicks in I think! I look forward to meeting all you fun, interesting people out there and I hope you enjoy the way in which I have adapted my beautiful London Townhouse for you!\r\n\r\nDespite being on airbnb for 2 months, I have hosted over 80 times and I have been really grateful to have met so many interesting people. I want to thank my guests for leaving such kind, warm words about me and my home.  Here are a sample of my guest reviews:\r\n\r\n\"Fabulous 4 (URL HIDDEN) our 50's. Thought it would be hard to give up our 5 star travelling days.But this gorgeous Chiswick English house generated warmth,oozed comfort, and delivered all it said it (URL HIDDEN) added extra was the charm and character of the (URL HIDDEN) nice to feel at ease and welcome.A real bonus to meet other people . Would return in a flash\" Georges and Debbie\r\n\r\n\"Adam's room is even better than what the pictures show, very bright and large and in a very nice neighborhood. The location is great, in a very residential neighborhood, but with many nice restaurants around, and walking distance to the tube station. Also, Adam made me feel very welcome, gave me all the instructions and help needed. Overall, it was a very good experience! Thank you, Adam!\" Betina\r\n\r\n\"Simply the best BNB experience I have had. Large clean rooms in a well organised apartment. Key code worked a dream and so much easier than meeting someone with the key when your phone does not work in that country. Also cheapest apartment in the area so what a deal to find it was a great place all round. Adam was just so friendly and professional. If I lived in that street he would be my new best friend! was a little concerned by a previous post, but I got the story from another guest (who had been there for a month! - thats how good a deal this flat it) and they told me what a nightmare this family had been and how Adam had tried to quieten them down to help the other guests and asked them to clean up their kitchen mess and then they wrote that vicous review!) ANyway, stay here. Easy walk to the Tube, amazing nightlife and real London pubs 1 minute a way, and a perfect BNB Host.\"",

Close to the city centre but with its own identity and community. In the immediate vicinity we have the best Italian restaurant, best bakery, best off-license, my favourite pub and the best Thai food i've eaten since Bangkok. There are cool cafes, vintage shops and an award-winning local supermarket (as well a choice of big supermarkets slightly further away, perhaps 10 minutes walk). The flat is central enough that many guests walk everywhere. You will find high street shopping, restaurants, pubs, historic tourist attractions and the picturesque walks that Edinburgh is famed for. PLACES OF INTEREST: The Royal Mile is less than 1 mile away, it is the heart of Edinburgh's old town. It links Holyrood Palace (the Queen's official residence in Scotland) and the Scottish Parliament with Edinburgh Castle. Halfway up is a section called High Street which is the epicentre of street th",

In particular if more than 1 person stays in this room for a week or more then I will manually apply a discount to the price you are quoted. When you enquire about renting this room I will send you a special offer with the correct price.",
    "transit": "PUBLIC TRANSPORT: Edinburgh is a small city so many guests find they can walk everywhere they wish to visit. However, if you prefer public transport or wish to visit the attractions on Edinburgh's outskirts (such as Rosslyn, Cramond and Portobello) then a close by bus route will take you there. The buses are now GPS tracked with arrival boards at the stops and you can even download a free app to your phone to see exactly how soon the next one is arriving.",
    "access": "CAPACITY: This listing is for a private room with a double bed which will sleep 2 people comfortably.",
    "interaction": "ARRIVING: The flat is about a mile from Waverley Train Station; you can walk, catch the no.1 bus or jump in a taxi. From the airport you can catch the regular (and inexpensive) no. 35 bus which brings you all the way to the flat in about an hour. SETTLING INTO THE FLAT: I will meet you when you arrive to hand over a set of keys, show you round the flat and answer any questions you may have about the accommodation, location and Edinburgh in general. After that, well I live here so ask questions when you see me or call if i'm out. You will get my email address when your booking is confirmed and my phone number is on all the key fobs.",
    "house_rules": "NO smoking inside the flat or stairwell.  If you have to smoke please go outside. Please check if anyone needs to use the bathroom before taking a shower. No shoes on the bedroom carpet or living room rug please. Please keep communal areas tidy, especially the kitchen:  Wipe surfaces, put dirty dishes in the dish-washer and wash pots, etc. Please be courteous and don't disturb the neighbours or other guests. Feel free to play CDs and enjoy the home cinema.  Please put CDs away carefully.  And DO NOT touch the turntable or vinyl. Pets are only allowed if cleared with myself in advance, a security deposit is paid and they do not damage anything. Report any issues promptly so I can sort them out, my phone number is on the key fob.",

    "description": "The room is very spacious and comfortable. It has a lot of storage and has also been recently repainted. (The flat is shown in a slightly wrong place on the map. Its actually near the junction of Morrison st and Grove st.) We offer a very large room (about 25m2). The flat is located very centrally - about 5 minutes walk to the Princess st, very close to many festival venues. Haymarket train station is also about 5 minutes walk away. There are plenty of shops, restaurants and bars in the area, however the street where the flat is located is residential and is generally more quite.

Lots to see with museums, galleries and historical sights and the odd dormant volcano that might be a good spot for a picnic. \r\nThere really is something for everyone.\r\nFestival time is when the city really comes to life with the largest arts festival in the world a fantastic experience.\r\nI love to travel and know what a difference having a comfortable and homely place to stay can make to a break away, so with that in mind I hope my apartment would have everything you need to make your stay enjoyable and I am here should you need anything during your stay x enjoy Edinburgh!",

I love the sea air, the local community, which combined give Joppa a very local feel but none-the-less minutes from the city centre. \r\nFor those travelling by road we are just of the main city by pass and the A1 to the east of the city.  Joppa and Portobello are well sign posted so you shouldn\u2019t have any trouble, however if you do feel free to call.  \r\n\r\nI particular enjoy the Air B&B experience given the diversity of people it allows me to meet.  I am passionate about my hometown and all too happy to offer up advice, guidance and support for anyone wishing to travel here irrespective if you are staying with me.\r\n\r\nOutside the peak season, I am also happy to cater for those on short to long-term work commitments.  Please call to discuss opportunities we may have.",

It is great neighbourhood and understandable one of the most desirable parts of Edinburgh.  Close to the city centre but with its own identity and community.   There's a Scotmid (which is the Scottish version of Co-op supermarket) 50m away. Just across the road from that is a great pub called the Earl of Marchmont which occasionally and quietly hosts some famous faces from the tele.  Also close by is a hardware store - very useful if you've got a show. There are loads of fruit and veg shops, the area is known for the having the best fresh produce in Edinburgh.  If that's not your thing then there are also pizza, fish n chips, Chinese and Indian take aways. And Sweet Melinda's is a decent restaurant well worth visiting. The flat is central enough that many guests walk everywhere.  You will find high street shopping, restaurants, pubs, historic tourist attractions and the picturesque w",
    "notes": "DISCOUNTS & CHARGES Some discounts are applied automatically.  For example, if you stay for a week you get 30% discount and if you stay for a month you 45% discount.  AirBnB's system is good but not perfect so I have to apply some discounts manually.  In particular if more than 6 people people stay in this flat for a week or more then I will manually apply a discount to the price you are quoted.   When you enquire about renting this flat I will send you a special offer with the correct price.  Similarly, if you want an extra bed and bedding to be provided beyond the 4 included beds there is a one-off charge that I will apply manually.  Regardless the length of your stay an extra single bed and bedding costs \u00a315 while a double bed and bedding costs \u00a325.",
    "transit": "PUBLIC TRANSPORT: Edinburgh is a small city so many guests find they can walk everywhere they wish to visit.  However, if you prefer public transport or wish to visit the attractions on Edinburgh's outskirts (such as Rosslyn, Cramond and Portobello) then a close by bus route will take you there.  The buses are now GPS tracked with arrival boards at the stops and you can even download a free app to your phone to see exactly how soon the next one is arriving.",
    "access": "CAPACITY: This listing is for the whole flat which has 3 dedicated bedrooms with proper beds for 6 people. The small living room will fit a single bed easily or a double if required.  Extra beds and bedding can be provided for a small additional fee. This allows up to 7 or 8 people to stay in the flat comfortably.  However the big front bedroom can be a triple or even quadruple so if the single bathroom isn't a problem for you then 9 or possibly 10 people could stay.",
    "interaction": "ARRIVING: The flat is just over a mile from both Waverley and Haymarket Train Stations; you can walk, catch the no.5 bus from the former or jump in a taxi.   From the airport you can catch the regular (and inexpensive) no. 35 bus to Lauriston Place which is 0.5 mile away.  Get off at and walk along Middle Meadow Walk. Or catch the Express 100 bus to either train station. SETTLING INTO THE FLAT: I will meet you when you arrive to hand over 3 sets of keys, show you round the flat and answer any questions you may have about the accommodation, location and Edinburgh in general.

I love the sea air, the local community, which combined give Joppa a very local feel but none-the-less minutes from the city centre. \r\nFor those travelling by road we are just of the main city by pass and the A1 to the east of the city.  Joppa and Portobello are well sign posted so you shouldn\u2019t have any trouble, however if you do feel free to call.  \r\n\r\nI particular enjoy the Air B&B experience given the diversity of people it allows me to meet.  I am passionate about my hometown and all too happy to offer up advice, guidance and support for anyone wishing to travel here irrespective if you are staying with me.\r\n\r\nOutside the peak season, I am also happy to cater for those on short to long-term work commitments.  Please call to discuss opportunities we may have.",

    "neighborhood_overview": "The flat is in Leith, a 2 minute walk away from the Ocean Terminal shopping centre and bus terminus. The Shore is also close - a 10 minute walk away, and has lots of great bars and restaurants in a lovely part of town. The water of Leith runs past the area, a 2 minute walk away from the flat. The flat is on the top floor of an old (B-listed) tenement building.",
    "notes": "I realise the price is quite high - this is just because I value my space and really only expect to take bookings during busy periods. For the sake of expectation management, based on feedback I've received, I'll also point out that due to the age of the building, the stair well isn't much to look at. It's tidy and everything - just old! Also, the guest bedroom does have curtains, but they still let in quite a lot of light in the mornings. Other than that, I'm sure you'll be very comfortable.",
    "transit": "I can recommend a very reliable local taxi company, but the bus connections are also very convenient. Being close to Ocean Terminal, the flat is: 1 minute walk to numbers 10 and 34 buses 2 minute walk to numbers 16, 22, 35 and 36 buses 4 minute walk to numbers 7, 14 and 21 buses There is also a free parking area next to the building.",
    "access": "You'll have unlimited access to your double bedroom, hallway, bathroom, kitchen and dining/living room, although you'll be sharing all of these but the bedroom with me. Once you \"check in\" and get keys, you can come and go as you like, but if you want to \"check in\" during business hours, I'll need you to meet me at my office 10 minutes away.",
    "interaction": "I work a 10 minute walk away from the flat, Mon-Fri 9am-5:30pm. I'll be available on my mobile in case of emergency, and will be around the flat most evenings/weekends. I'll probably mostly keep to myself, but I'll be available a lot of the time if you need anything, and am happy to help you get orientated and recommend good places to go for food/drinks etc.",
    "house_rules": "Come and go as you like - please just keep the noise down after 11pm (12 at weekends), clean up any kitchenware you use, don't bring anyone to the flat other than the agreed/booked guests, make sure the bathroom is free between 7:40-8am every week day, and generally try to be respectful of the place.",

If I had to chose five things I couldn't live without They would be in no particular order - * My friends, * Good food, * My Car, * Eyelashes & of course * My mobile phone. =).\r\n\r\nI enjoy meeting new people and love to interact with people of all cultures and get to experience this especially during the Edinburgh festival with people visiting Edinburgh from so many countries across the world. \r\n\r\nYou only live once so make sure you do the best you can in everything. :)",
